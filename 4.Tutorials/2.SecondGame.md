# Playing Your Second Game

To make the rules and mechanisms easier to learn, we have prepared simplified rules for your second game. This builds on your first game *(see Playing Your First Game)* and is a guided tutorial game using a subset of the full rules to establish the core principles of the game and get familiar with the terminology and processes.
