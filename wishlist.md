  - Still on the fence. Already have 1s count as 2 successes
- [ ] Mission generator - Objectives and bonuses
- [ ] Introduce Magic attacks?

# Notes

- How to still translate KT operatives, weapons, actions, abilities, equipment, tacops, ploys to Skirm agents?
- Per team tactics
  - Replaces ploys
  - Must use TOs
- Bring back special die?
  - Explode special die on critical success?
    - Or any success? Could have regular dice explode on critical, special die explode on any success
  - Something else?
  - Critical success on special die gives a TO?
- Rivalries!
  - Advantage/disadvantage vs specific teams/tags
- Quirks
  - Think space marine gene taints for example
- Really think about X- vs X+ on rolls
- Need overwatch mechanism
  - Shoot only?
  - Any action?
  - Spend AP during activation to set up "sentry" (= overwatch)?
- Squad building
  - Predefined only
  - Eq pts
- Remove Medic from Terran Knights, but only once we have another team defined that has a Medic (just don't want to lose that write-up)
