# Notes

- Why dash if I can TO another full move?
  - Because TOs are limited?
  - Don't allow repeated actions using TOs?
- Special actions - Is 2 TO too expensive?
- Redo combat - Armor should apply in melee, not just shooting
  - By making armor reduce damage?
  - Still want defensive rolls for melee and shooting
    - Dodge skill vs Melee skill?
- How to still translate KT operatives to Skirm agents?
- Melee rolls: -1 die for target? +1 die for attacker?
  - Give an advantage to attacker
  - Maybe special skill for melee specialists?
    - e.g. "Melee Attack 2" -> +2 dice when attacking
- Per team tactics
  - Replaces ploys
  - Must use TOs
- Bring back special die?
  - Explode special die on critical success?
    - Or any success? Could have regular dice explode on critical, special die explode on any success
  - Something else?
  - Critical success on special die gives a TO?
- TOs to be used to re-roll OR modify a single die's result by +/-1 (stackable)
  - Special ability ("arcane warp mastery") for certain teams to spend TO to change opponent's roll value or force a die re-roll for double TO cost
- Rivalries!
  - Advantage/disadvantage vs specific teams/tags
- Quirks
  - Think space marine gene taints for example
- FNP -> "Tough"
  - e.g "Tough 3" means HP not lost on 3-, roll for every HP lost
- Really think about X- vs X+ on rolls
- Fewer basic actions, move others to mission actions
- Move specialist actions to Agent skills section
- No repeating actions, even with TOs?
- ~~Consider agents with own weapons vs shared armory~~
  - ~~Agents would have modifiers to weapon stats (e.g. better to-hit or RoF or DAM)~~
    - ~~Like Warzone~~
    - **No**
- Need overwatch mechanism
  - Shoot only?
  - Any action?
  - Spend AP during activation to set up "sentry" (= overwatch)?
- Re-label all stats with 3 characters (ACT, MOV, ARM, HIT, TYP, ROA, SKL, DAM)
- Squad building
  - Predefined only?
  - Eq pts?
  - Points system?
  -  Also points on weapon selections?

# Combat Rewrite (2023-08-06)

- Is RC/MC (SKL) an attribute of the agent or the weapon? Or both? Summarize on weapon stat line?
  - Both: Property of this weapon in this agent's hand
  - No shared armory
- Ranged combat:
  - Roll against RC skill for each ROA
    - Equipment may modify RC
  - Success means bullet reached target
  - Target rolls ARM against DAM
    - ARM - DAM = Target to save (e.g. 7 - 4 = 3- to save)
    - Lose 1 HP per failed save
      - ~~Or lose DAM HP per failed save?~~ **No**
  - Skills and equipment may modify ROF, DAM, or AR or give auto successes/saves
    - e.g. Camo cloak (only if distance > 3 squares) for ranged combat, Dodge for melee combat
      - Dodge and Camo may:
        - Reduce DAM
        - Increase AR
        - Give free successful saves
        - Give free re-rolls
    - Armor Penetration does unsaveable damage
      -  Don't roll for AR, lose HP immediately (mortal wounds)
        - Not one per success, but maybe "your first X successes are unsaveable"?
        - Use die roll of 1 as critical success for unsaveable DAM instead?
- Melee combat:
  - Same as Ranged
  - Not opposed
  - Opportunity for target to riposte or disengage if still standing
  - ~~Off vs Def score for melee weapon?~~
    - Too complicated, skipping for now
