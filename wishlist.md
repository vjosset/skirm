- [ ] Progression/narrative
- [ ] Coop and solo modes
- [ ] Mission generator - Objectives and bonuses
- [ ] Introduce Magic attacks?

- [x] ~~Better Shoot rules to have Target roll defense~~
- [x] ~~Better Melee rules by making it more interactive~~
- [x] ~~Defense - Always use 3 dice, with modifiers/special rules on some weapons? (GDFF)~~ - **No, make it explicit and simple**

- [x] ~~Think about double success on 1s vs success chains~~

# Notes

- How to still translate KT operatives, weapons, actions, abilities, equipment, tacops, ploys to Skirm agents?
- Per team tactics
  - Replaces ploys
  - Must use TOs
- Rivalries!
  - Advantage/disadvantage vs specific teams/tags
- Quirks
  - Think space marine gene taints for example
