# Line Of Sight

A Target is said to be in an Attacker's **Line of Sight** if:

* An interrupted line can be drawn from one of the corners of the Square occupied by the Attacker to two corners of the Square occupied by the Target.

## Hitbox

An Agent's **Hitbox** defines the area that can be targeted for a Ranged attack. The Hitbox is a cylinder whose radius is the Agent model's base and whose height is the top of the Agent's head.  
This means that any part of the Agent's model that extends beyond the bounds of its base (e.g. extended arms) or extend above its head (e.g. raised weapon) are not considered targetable areas for a Ranged attack.

## Cover

If a Target model can be seen from the Attacker's head but its base cannot be seen in its entirety from the Attacker's head, that Target is in Cover (see [Modifiers](../3.Actions/3.Shoot.md#modifiers) for the effects of Cover).
