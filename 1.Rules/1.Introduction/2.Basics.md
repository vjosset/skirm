# Basics

This section covers the Basic rules of Skirm, and establishes core principles that are extended in later sections of the rules.

# Alternate Activations

Each player takes alternating turns activating the Agents in their Squad. For example, in order:
1. Player 1 activates their first Agent
1. Player 2 activates their first Agent
1. Player 1 activates their second Agent
1. Player 2 activates their second Agent
1. Player 1 activates their third Agent
1. Player 2 activates their third Agent
1. (etc)

If a player has fewer Agents in play than their opponent, you may run into cases where your opponent still has Agents to activate but all your own Agents have already been activated. In those cases, when it is your turn to activate an Agent, you may choose to have one of your Agents perform a Sentry action.  

## Sentry Actions

Sentry Actions:
- Do not cost `ACT` or `TO` to perform
- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn (meaning each Agent can only perform one Sentry action per Turn)
- Do not count against the maximum limit of Actions performed per Turn (meaning an Agent may use a Sentry Action for Ranged Combat even if they already performed a Ranged Combat Action during their activation in this Turn)
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

# Dice Rolls

## Basics

Skirm uses 6-sided dice for all rolls. These will be indicated throughout the rules as `D6`.  
Some rolls will require more than one die. For those, the number of dice to roll will be indicated before `D6`.  
For example, to indicate a roll of 3 dice: `3D6`. To indicate a roll of 1 die: `1D6`.

## Modifying A Die Result

Some rolls will require adding a number to a die's value. For example, to indicate a roll whose result should be increased by `2`: `1D6+2`. This means roll a die, then add `2` to its value to get the final value.

## Rolling A D3

Some rolls will require roll a `D3`. Since three-sided dice are not readily available, roll a `D6` and divide its result by `2`, rounding up.

## Successes and Failures

When rolling against a character or weapon stat, a die roll is a success if its value is equal to or lower than that stat.  
Irrespective of any modifiers or Stats, a die roll of `6` is always a failure.  
A die roll of `1` is always a success, and counts as two successes.

## Re-Rolls

Certain rules and events allow you to re-roll a die. In those cases, announce the die to be re-rolled, pick it up, and roll it again. Once a die is re-rolled, its result is final and it cannot be re-rolled again.

# Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, each player rolls `3D6` and adds 1 die for each standing Agent's `LDx` Special Rule. For example, if your Leader is Standing and has the `LD2` Special Rule, you would roll `5D6` for Tactical Orders (3 base dice for Tactical Orders plus 2 dice provided by your Leader).  
If you do not have a Standing Agent with the `LDx` Special Rule on the Battlemap, you do not get their Tactical Order bonus and just roll `3D6`.

For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order. Tactical Orders allow Agents to perform more Actions than their `ACT` Action limit.

At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost; they do not carry over to the following Turn.

Note that rolling for Tactical Orders cannot be modified by using Tactical Orders.

## Using Tactical Orders

During an Agent's activation, you may spend any number of Tactical Orders you obtained for that Turn on more actions for that Agent. Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action (Move, Dash, Shoot, Melee, etc.) during an Agent's Activation
    * Note that a same Action cannot be performed more than once by a given Agent during their Activation (regardless of whether that Agent used ACT or TOs to perform it) unless that Agent has Special rules indicating otherwise (e.g. `2R` - Double Ranged Combat - See [Special Rules](../2.Squads/3.SpecialRules.md)).
* Re-roll any one die for any roll (including during one of your opponent's Agents' Activations, for example during Melee combat)
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1. Note that this is stackable; you can spend 2 TOs to reduce the result of a die by 2, or spend multiple TOs on multiple dice in a given roll.

# Scoring Points And Controlling Objectives

Each Battle Map will have Objectives placed on it. Depending on the mission, these Objectives may need to be controlled to score Mission Points.

An Agent that occupies the same Square as an Objective is said to control that Objective. At the end of each Turn, your Squad scores one Mission Point for each Objective that one of your Agents controls.
