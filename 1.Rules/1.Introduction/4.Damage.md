# Damage

During the battle, Agents will inflict **Damage** on each other. Damage is a measurement of how badly an attack hurt an Agent.

When inflicting Damage on an Agent (as a result of a [Combat](../3.Actions/3.Combat.md) Action for example):

* The Target will lose a number of `HIT` equal to the number of failed saves.
* If an Agent reaches zero or fewer `HIT`, it is **Downed**. To indicate that an Agent is Downed, place it on its side in the Square it currently occupies.
    * Downed Agents cannot be activated
* During the rest of the Turn, a Downed Agent's SquadMates can [revive](../3.Actions/1.Actions.md#revive-2-act) this Downed Agent.
* At the end of each Turn, all Downed Agents are removed from play. They can no longer be revived.
