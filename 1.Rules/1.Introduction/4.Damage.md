# Damage

During the battle, Agents will inflict **Damage** on each other. Damage is a measurement of how badly an attack hurt an Agent.

When inflicting Damage on an Agent (as a result of a [Shoot](../3.Actions/3.Shoot.md) or [Melee](../3.Actions/4.Melee.md) Action for example):

* The Damage inflicted is the `D` stat of the Weapon that was used in a Shoot or Melee Action, multiplied by the number of remaining successful hits.
    * The Target will lose a number of `HP` equal to the Weapon's `D` Stat.
* If an Agent reaches zero or fewer `HP`, it is **Downed**. To indicate that an Agent is Downed, place it on its side in the Square it currently occupies.
    * Downed Agents cannot be activated
* At the end of each Turn, all Downed Agents are removed from play. They can no longer be revived.
