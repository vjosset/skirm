# Actions

During its activation, an Agent can perform a number of Actions up to its `AP` stat *(see [StatCards](../2.Squads/1.StatCards.md))*.  
Each Action consumes a number of Action Points or `AP`.

Actions with an `AP` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `AP` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

# Basic Actions

All Agents can perform the following Actions during their Activation:

## Move (1 AP)

The Agent moves a number of squares up to its `MV` stat.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](./2.Movement.md))*

## Dash (1 AP)

The Agent moves up to `2` Squares. This movement follows the same rules as a normal Move.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](./2.Movement.md))*

## Shoot (1 AP)

The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target. Note that if an Agent does not have a Range weapon, it cannot perform this Action.  
*(See also [Actions-Shoot](./3.Shoot.md))*

## Melee (1 AP)

Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.  
*(See also [Actions-Melee](./4.Melee.md))*

## Revive (2 AP)
The Agent revives a Downed Agent in an Adjacent Square.  
When an Downed Agent is revived, it returns with `2` HP remaining, and it cannot be activated during this Turn.  
The Agent cannot perform this Action in the same activation in which it performed an Advanced Revive Action.

## Open Door (1 AP)

The Agent opens a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

## Close Door (1 AP)

The Agent closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

## Pick Up (1 AP)

The Agent picks up a marker or token that is in the Square it currently occupies. The mission you are playing will indicate which markers or tokens can be picked up or dropped.

## Drop (1 AP)

The Agent drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies. The mission you are playing will indicate which markers or tokens can be picked up or dropped.

## Pass (1 AP)

The Agent does nothing. This is the only Action that all Agents can perform more than once during their Activation.
