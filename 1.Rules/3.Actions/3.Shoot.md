# Shoot

The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target.

## Step By Step

1. Selections
    1. The Attacker selects one of its Ranged weapons to use in this Shoot action.
    1. If the Attacker has no Ranged weapons, it cannot perform this action.
    1. The Attacker selects a valid Target.
        1. If the selected weapon has a limited range (Weapon Special Rule `RGx`), make sure the Target is within the weapon's range.
        1. The selected target must be at least 2 Squares away; an Agent cannot target an Agent in and adjacent Square with a ranged weapon.
        1. The selected Target must be in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](../1.Introduction/5.LineOfSight.md)
1. Roll Attack Dice
    1. The Attacker rolls a number of dice equal to the `R` Stat of its selected Ranged weapon.
    1. All die results that are equal to or lower than the selected Ranged weapon's `S` Stat are successes, any others are failures.
        1. Remember that die results of `1` are always successes, and die results of `6` are always failures (regardless of any other modifiers or rules).
1. Roll Save
    1. The Target rolls a number of `D6` equal to its `DF` Stat. Any result that is less than or equal to its `AR` Stat are successful saves. Each successful save removes one successful hit.
1. Resolve remaining hits
    1. For each remaining successful hit, the Target takes the selected Ranged Weapon's `D` [Damage](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md)
