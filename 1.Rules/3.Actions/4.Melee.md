# Melee

Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.

## Step By Step

1. Selections
    1. The Attacker selects a valid target in an Adjacent square
    1. The Attacker selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
1. Roll Attack Dice
    1. The Attacker rolls the `R` dice for its selected Melee weapon
        1. All die results that are equal to or lower than the selected Melee weapon's `S` stat are successes, any others are failures
    1. The Target selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
    1. The Target rolls the `R` dice for its selected Melee weapon
        1. All die results that are equal to or lower than the selected Melee weapon's `S` stat are successes, any others are failures
1. Resolve Successful Hits
    1. If the Attacker has more successes than the Target
        1. Subtract the Target's number of successes from the Attacker's number of successes. Inflict the selected Melee Weapon's `D` [Damage](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md) to the Target for each remaining success.
    1. If the Target has more successes than the Attacker
        1. Subtract the Attacker's number of successes from the Targets's number of successes. Inflict the selected Melee Weapon's `D` [Damage](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md) to the Attacker for each remaining success.
    1. If the Attacker and the Target had the same number of successes, no damage is inflicted on either Agent.
