# Melee

Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.

## Step By Step

1. The Attacker selects a valid target in an Adjacent square
1. The Attacker selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
1. The Attacker rolls the `ROA` dice for its selected Melee weapon
1. All die results that are equal to or lower than the selected Melee weapon's `HIT` stat are successes, any others are failures
1. The Target selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
1. The Target rolls the `ROA` dice for its selected Melee weapon
1. All die results that are equal to or lower than the selected Melee weapon's `HIT` stat are successes, any others are failures
    1. If the Attacker has more successes than the Target
        1. Subtract the Target's number of successes from the Attacker's number of successes. Inflict `DAM` damage minus the Targets's `AR` (Armor) value on the Target once for each success the Attacker had above the Target. *(See [Damage](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md))*
    1. If the Target has more successes than the Attacker
        1. Subtract the Attacker's number of successes from the Targets's number of successes. Inflict `DAM` damage minus the Attacker's `AR` (Armor) value on the Attacker once for each success the Target had above the Attacker. *(See [Damage](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md))*
    1. If the Attacker and the Target had the same number of successes, no damage is inflicted on either Agent.
