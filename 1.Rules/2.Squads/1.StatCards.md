# StatCards

StatCards describe your Agents and their Weapons with numerical values. In general, the higher the number, the better the Agent or Weapon.  
StatCards also indicate important Tags that apply to the Agent and Special Actions or Abilities the Agent has.

## Skills

> ## Skills
> 
> * **War Cry (1 TO):** All squadmates within 5 Squares of this Agent gain +1 `ROA` to their Ranged and Melee weapons

Some Agents will have Skills listed on their StatCard. These are unique properties of that Agent that may allow them to perform a specific unique Action, or gain a bonus (or debuff) for certain game mechanics.

Note that Skills that have a **TO** cost (as above) **cannot** be performed using the Agent's **ACT** Stat; they **must** be performed by spending [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).  
Skills that have an AP cost can be performed using the Agent's AP Stat **or** a [Tactical Order](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).

Skills that do not have an **AP** or **TO** cost are passive skills that do not require spending an Action Point or Tactical Order.
