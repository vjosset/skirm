# SKIRM - Lite Rules

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.  
These rules are a simplified version of the full [rulebook](1.Rules.md); they are intended for introductory or quick play, or as a reference during play.

# Turns

There are four Turns in each Skirm battle.
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Agents as Ready
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Lowest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events for this Turn
1. Agent activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Agent, then Squads alternate activating their Agents until all Agents have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](1.Rules.md#alternate-activations) and [Sentry Actions](#sentry-actions)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission

# Actions

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two.  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).  
Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

**Move (1 ACT)**
The Agent moves a number of Squares up to its `MOV` stat.  

**Dash (1 ACT)**
The Agent moves up to `1` Square.

**Shoot (1 ACT)**
The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target.

**Melee (1 ACT)**
The Agent attacks an Adjacent enemy Agent in Melee combat.

**Open/Close Door (1 ACT)**
The Agent opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

**Pick Up/Drop (1 ACT)**
The Agent picks up or drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies.

## Sentry Actions

- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

# Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, roll `3D6` + 1 die for each of the Squad's Agents' `LDx` Special Rule.  
For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order for that Turn.
At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost.  
Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action during an Agent's Activation
* Re-roll any one die for any roll
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1 (stackable). Note that modifying a die roll in this way cannot turn a die roll into a Critical roll.

# Combat

# Ranged Combat

**Selection**: Select a valid Target in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](#line-of-sight)
**Roll Strikes**: Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA`. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` is a successful strike.  
**Roll Saves**: For each of the Attacker's successful strikes, the Target rolls one Save die. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target loses one `HIT`.

## Melee Combat

**Selection**: Select a valid Target in an Adjacent Square  
**Roll Strikes**: Attacker and Target roll one die for each of their selected weapons' `ROA`. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` is a successful strike.  
**Compare Strikes**: The Agent with more successful strikes is the "winner"; the Agent with fewer strikes is the "loser". Reduce the number of the winner's successful strikes by the loser's number of successful strikes.  
**Roll Saves**: For each of the winner's remaining successful strikes, the loser rolls one Save die. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the loser loses one `HIT`.

## Line Of Sight

A Target is said to be in an Attacker's **Line of Sight** if two uninterrupted lines can be drawn from one of the corners of the Square occupied by the Attacker to two corners of the Square occupied by the Target.  
Note that an Agent cannot target an enemy Agent for Ranged Combat if there are other Agents on that Line of Sight (i.e. an Agent cannot shot "through" other Agents).

|`2RC`|**Double Ranged Combat**|This Agent can perform the [Range Combat Action](#combat) twice in its activation.|
|`CAM`|**Camouflage**|When this Agent is the target of a Ranged Combat Attack and the Attacker is more than `3` Squares away, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful strikes.|
|`CSx`|**Critical Save x**|When this Agent rolls Saves (when it is the target of a combat attack for example), rolls of `x` or lower are treated as Critical and trigger a Critical Chain.|
|`DOD`|**Dodge**|When this Agent is the target of a Melee Combat Attack, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful strikes.|
|`DRx`|**Damage Reduction x**|Each time this Agent is the target of a Ranged or Melee Combat attack, one successful attack deals -`x` DAM (Damage)|
|`HLx`|**Heal x**|This Agent regains `x` lost `HIT` at the start of each Turn|
|`LDx`|**Leader x**|While this Agent is in the battle, you can roll for an additional `x` Tactical Orders every turn.|
|`TFx`|**Tough x**|Whenever this Agent would lose a `HIT`, roll `1D6`: on `x` or lower, that `HIT` is not lost.|

### Weapon Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`APx`|**Armor Piercing x**|When this weapon is used in [Combat](#combat), `x` successful Attacks cannot be saved by the Target. For example: Using an `AP1` Ranged weapon, the Target would roll 1 fewer Save dice than the Attacker's successful Attacks. If the Target has `CAM` (Camouflage) or `DOD` (Dodge), those automatic successful saves cannot be used against this Armor Piercing special rule.|

|`HVY`|**Heavy**|This weapon is too heavy to shoot in the same activation as moving. Shooting this weapon after the Agent performed a Move Action costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). A Move Action performed after this Agent shot this weapon costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). Agents can perform a Dash Action with this weapon equipped without any penalties.|
|`LIM`|**Limited Ammo**|This weapon can only be used once during the battle.|
|`LNR`|**Linear**|All Agents (including squadmates) between the Attacker and original Target who occupy a Square that crosses the Line Of Sight are Targets. Resolve Attacks and Saves on each such Target separately.|
|`RGx`|**Range x**|The weapon's maximum range for target selection is `x` Squares|
|`RRx`|**Re-Roll x**|Attacker can re-roll up to `x` Attack dice|
|`VAx`|**Vampire x**|If at least one success inflicts [Damage](#damage) on the Target, this Agent regains `x` lost `HIT`|
|`XPL`|**Explode**|Every time the Agent fires this weapon, it fires against the target and any other Agent (including squadmates) in adjacent Squares to the original Target. Roll Attack dice for each affected Agent. Note that this weapon can target an unoccupied Square (rather than having to target an Agent).|
