# SKIRM - The Rules - Lite Version

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.  
These rules are a simplified version of the full [rulebook](1.Rules.md); they are intended for introductory or quick play.

# Game Cycle

A game of Skirm is played in the following order:

1. Mission Start
   1. Select Mission (See [Missions](2.Missions))
   1. Select Squad (See [Squads](#squads-and-agents))
   1. Prepare Battle Map
   1. Deploy Agents
1. Turns
   1. Turn 1
   1. Turn 2
   1. Turn 3
   1. Turn 4
1. Mission End

# Turns

During each Turn:
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Agents as Ready (not Activated)
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events (e.g. "Heal")
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Highest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events (if any) for this Turn
1. Agent activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Agent, then Squads alternate activating their Agents until all Agents have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](#alternate-activations) and [Sentry action](#sentry-actions)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission
    1. Remove all Downed Agents from the Battlemap.

# Actions

During its activation, an Agent can perform a number of Actions up to its `ACT` stat *(see [StatCards](#stat-cards))*.  
Each Action costs a number of Action Points or `ACT`.

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two (for example, if an Agent's skill costs `2 ACT`, you can spend 1 `ACT` + 1 `TO` to perform that action).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

## Basic Actions

All Agents can perform the following Actions during their Activation:

### Move (1 ACT)

The Agent moves a number of squares up to its `MOV` stat.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](#movement))*

### Dash (1 ACT)

The Agent moves up to `2` Squares. This movement follows the same rules as a normal Move.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](#movement))*

### Shoot (1 ACT)

The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target. Note that if an Agent does not have a Range weapon, it cannot perform this Action.  
*(See also [Actions - Combat](#combat))*

### Melee (1 ACT)

Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.  
*(See also [Actions - Combat](#combat))*

### Open/Close Door (1 ACT)

The Agent opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

### Pick Up (1 ACT)

The Agent picks up a marker or token that is in the Square it currently occupies. The mission you are playing will indicate which markers or tokens can be picked up or dropped.

### Drop (1 ACT)

The Agent drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies. The mission you are playing will indicate which markers or tokens can be picked up or dropped.

### Revive (2 TO)

The Agent revives a [Downed](#damage) Agent in an Adjacent Square.  
When an Downed Agent is revived, it returns with `1D3` `HIT` remaining, and it cannot be activated during this Turn (it is considered to have already been activated).  
The Agent cannot perform this Action in the same activation in which it performed an Advanced Revive Action.  
The Agent cannot perform this action if it is Adjacent to a Standing Enemy Agent, or if the Downed Agent is Adjacent to a Standing Enemy Agent.

## Sentry Actions

If a player has fewer Agents in play than their opponent, you may run into cases where your opponent still has Agents to activate but all your own Agents have already been activated. In those cases, when it is your turn to activate an Agent, you may choose to have one of your Agents perform a [Sentry action](#sentry-actions).  

Sentry Actions:
- Do not cost `ACT` or `TO` to perform
- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn (meaning each Agent can only perform at most one Sentry Action per Turn)
- Do not count against the maximum limit of Actions performed per Turn (meaning an Agent may use a Sentry Action for Ranged Combat even if they already performed a Ranged Combat Action during their activation in this Turn)
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

# Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, each player rolls `3D6` and adds 1 die for each standing Agent's `LDx` Special Rule.  
For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order for that Turn. Tactical Orders allow Agents to perform more Actions than their `ACT` Action limit or modify certain rolls.
At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost; they do not carry over to the following Turn.

During an Agent's activation, you may spend any number of Tactical Orders you obtained for that Turn on more actions for that Agent. Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action (Move, Dash, Shoot, Melee, etc.) during an Agent's Activation
    * Note that a same Action cannot be performed more than once by a given Agent during their Activation (regardless of whether that Agent used ACT or TOs to perform it) unless that Agent has Special rules indicating otherwise (e.g. `2R` - Double Ranged Combat - See [Special Rules](#special-rules)).
* Re-roll any one die for any roll (including during one of your opponent's Agents' Activations, for example during Melee combat)
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1. Note that this is stackable; you can spend 2 TOs to reduce the result of a die by 2, or spend multiple TOs on multiple dice in a given roll.

# Combat

Ranged and Melee combat uses the same general process for determining hits and damage. The main difference is in target selection.

1. **Selections**
    1. Select a valid Target in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](#line-of-sight)
1. **Roll Hits**
    1. Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA` (Rate of Attack) + applicable [Modifiers](#modifiers).
    1. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` (Skill) is a successful Hit.
1. **Roll Saves**
    1. For each of the Attacker's successful Attacks, the Target rolls one Save die
    1. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target loses one `HIT`

## Modifiers

### Ranged Combat Modifiers

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is at least 2 Squares lower than Attacker|Attacker `SKL` +1|
|Friendly Fire|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` -1|
|Cover|Target is in [Cover](#cover)|Target `ARM` +1|

### Melee Combat Modifiers

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is 1 Square lower than Attacker|Attacker `SKL` +1|
|Support|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` +1|

## Damage

During the battle, Agents will inflict **Damage** on each other. Damage is a measurement of how badly an attack hurt an Agent.

When inflicting Damage on an Agent (as a result of a [Combat](#combat) Action for example):

* The Target will lose a number of `HIT` equal to the number of failed saves.
* If an Agent reaches zero or fewer `HIT`, it is **Downed**. To indicate that an Agent is Downed, place it on its side in the Square it currently occupies.
    * Downed Agents cannot be activated
* During the rest of the Turn, a Downed Agent's SquadMates can [revive](#revive-2-to) this Downed Agent.
* At the end of each Turn, all Downed Agents are removed from play. They can no longer be revived.

## Line Of Sight

A Target is said to be in an Attacker's **Line of Sight** if an interrupted line can be drawn from one of the corners of the Square occupied by the Attacker to two corners of the Square occupied by the Target.

# Appendix

## Special Rules

These standard Special Rules can be found on various Agents and their Weapons. These charts indicate each Special Rule's meaning and interpretation in gameplay.

### Agent Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`LDx`|**Leader x**|While this Agent is [Standing](#damage), you can roll for an additional `x` Tactical Orders every turn.|
|`2R`|**Double Ranged**|This Agent can perform the [Range Combat Action](#combat) twice in its activation.|
|`2M`|**Double Melee**|This Agent can perform the [Melee Action](#combat) twice in its activation.|
|`HLx`|**Heal x**|This Agent regains `x` lost `HIT` at the end of every Turn (unless it is **Downed**)|
|`CAM`|**Camouflage**|When this Agent is the target of a Ranged Combat Attack and the Attacker is more than `3` Squares away, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful hits.|
|`DOD`|**Dodge**|When this Agent is the target of a Melee Combat Attack, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful hits.|
|`TFx`|**Tough x**|Whenever this Agent would lose a `HIT`, roll `1D6`: on `x` or lower, that `HIT` is not lost.|

### Weapon Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`RRx`|**Re-Roll x**|Attacker can re-roll up to `x` Attack dice|
|`CRx`|**Critial x**|Die results of up to `x` are treated as Critical, resulting in double successes. (instead of only `1`)|
|`RGx`|**Range x**|The weapon's maximum range for target selection is `x` Squares|
|`XPL`|**Explode**|Every time the Agent fires this weapon, it fires against the target and any other Agent (including squadmates) in adjacent Squares to the original Target. Roll Attack dice for each affected Agent. Note that this weapon can target an unoccupied Square (rather than having to target an Agent).|
|`LIM`|**Limited Ammo**|This weapon can only be used once during the battle.|
|`APx`|**Armor Piercing x**|When this weapon is used in [Combat](#combat), `x` successful Attacks cannot be saved by the Target. For example: Using an `AP1` Ranged weapon, the Target would roll 1 fewer Save dice than the Attacker's successful Attacks. If the Target has `CAM` (Camouflage) or `DOD` (Dodge), those automatic successful saves cannot be used against this Armor Piercing special rule.|
|`VAx`|**Vampire x**|If at least one success inflicts [Damage](#damage) on the Target, this Agent regains `x` lost `HIT`|
|`HVY`|**Heavy**|This weapon is too heavy to shoot in the same activation as moving. Shooting this weapon after the Agent performed a Move Action costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). A Move Action performed after this Agent shot this weapon costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). Agents can perform a Dash Action with this weapon equipped without any penalties.|
|`LIN`|**Linear**|All Agents (including squadmates) between the Attacker and original Target who occupy a Square that crosses the Line Of Sight are Targets. Resolve Attacks and Saves on each such Target separately.|
|`NCV`|**No Cover**|The Target is never considered to be in [Cover](#cover)|
