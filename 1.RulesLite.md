# SKIRM - Lite Rules

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.  
These rules are a simplified version of the full [rulebook](1.Rules.md); they are intended for introductory or quick play, or as a reference during play.

# Turns

There are four Turns in each Skirm battle.
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Agents as Ready
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Lowest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events for this Turn
1. Agent activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Agent, then Squads alternate activating their Agents until all Agents have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](1.Rules.md#alternate-activations) and [Sentry Actions](#sentry-actions)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission

# Actions

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two.  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).  
Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

**Move (1 ACT)**
The Agent moves a number of Squares up to its `MOV` stat.  

**Dash (1 ACT)**
The Agent moves up to `2` Squares.

**Shoot (1 ACT)**
The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target.

**Melee (1 ACT)**
The Agent attacks an Adjacent enemy Agent in Melee combat.

**Open/Close Door (1 ACT)**
The Agent opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

**Pick Up/Drop (1 ACT)**
The Agent picks up or drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies.

## Sentry Actions

- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

# Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, roll `3D6` + 1 die for each Agent's `LDx` Special Rule.  
For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order for that Turn.
At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost.  
Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action during an Agent's Activation
* Re-roll any one die for any roll
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1 (stackable)

# Combat

# Ranged Combat

**Selection**: Select a valid Target in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](#line-of-sight)
**Roll Hits**: Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA`. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` is a successful Hit.  
**Roll Saves**: For each of the Attacker's successful Hits, the Target rolls one Save die. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target loses one `HIT`.

## Melee Combat

**Selection**: Select a valid Target in an Adjacent Square  
**Roll Hits**: Attacker and Target roll one die for each of their selected weapons' `ROA`. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` is a successful Hit.  
**Compare Hits**: The Agent with more successful hits is the "winner"; the Agent with fewer hits is the "loser". Reduce the number of the winner's successful Hits by the loser's number of successful hits.  
**Roll Saves**: For each of the winner's remaining successful Hits, the loser rolls one Save die. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the loser loses one `HIT`.

## Line Of Sight

A Target is said to be in an Attacker's **Line of Sight** if two uninterrupted lines can be drawn from one of the corners of the Square occupied by the Attacker to two corners of the Square occupied by the Target.  
Note that an Agent cannot target an enemy Agent for Ranged Combat if there are other Agents on that Line of Sight (i.e. an Agent cannot shot "through" other Agents).
