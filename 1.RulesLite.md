# SKIRM - Lite Rules

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.  
These rules are a simplified version of the full [rulebook](1.Rules.md); they are intended for introductory or quick play.

# Turns

There are four Turns in each Skirm battle.
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Agents as Ready (not Activated)
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events (e.g. "Heal")
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Highest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events (if any) for this Turn
1. Agent activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Agent, then Squads alternate activating their Agents until all Agents have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](#alternate-activations) and [Sentry action](#sentry-actions)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission
    1. Remove all Downed Agents from the Battlemap.

# Actions

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two.  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).  
Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

## Basic Actions

**Move (1 ACT)**
The Agent moves a number of squares up to its `MOV` stat.  

**Dash (1 ACT)**
The Agent moves up to `2` Squares. This movement follows the same rules as a normal Move.

**Shoot (1 ACT)**
The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target. Note that if an Agent does not have a Range weapon, it cannot perform this Action.

**Melee (1 ACT)**
Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.

**Open/Close Door (1 ACT)**
The Agent opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

**Pick Up (1 ACT)**
The Agent picks up a marker or token that is in the Square it currently occupies.

**Drop (1 ACT)**
The Agent drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies.

**Revive (2 TO)**
The Agent revives a [Downed](#damage) Agent in an Adjacent Square.  
When an Downed Agent is revived, it returns with `1D3` `HIT` remaining, and it cannot be activated during this Turn (it is considered to have already been activated).

## Sentry Actions

- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

# Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, each player rolls `3D6` and adds 1 die for each standing Agent's `LDx` Special Rule.  
For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order for that Turn.
At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost.  
Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action during an Agent's Activation
* Re-roll any one die for any roll
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1 (stackable)

# Combat

1. **Selections**
    1. Select a valid Target in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](#line-of-sight) (Ranged Combat) or in an Adjacent Square (Melee Combat)
1. **Roll Hits**
    1. Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA`
    1. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` is a successful Hit
1. **Roll Saves**
    1. For each of the Attacker's successful Attacks, the Target rolls one Save die
    1. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target loses one `HIT`
