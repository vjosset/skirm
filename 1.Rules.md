## Game Cycle

A game of Skirm is played in the following order:

1. Mission Start
   1. Select Mission
   1. Select Squad
   1. Prepare Battle Map
   1. Deploy Agents
1. Turns
   1. Turn 1
   1. Turn 2
   1. Turn 3
   1. Turn 4
1. Mission End

## Mission Start

### Select Mission

*(See [Missions](../../2.Missions))*

Select a Mission to play. Both players must reach consensus on the Mission to play.

### Select Squad

*(See [Squads](../../3.Squads))*

Select one of your Squads to take on the Mission

### Prepare Battle Map

Set up your Battlemap according to the Mission's briefing. This includes placing buildings and other terrain features, placing objectives, and any other actions defined by the selected Mission.

### Deploy Agents

Roll-off to determine the first Squad to deploy their first Agent. The winner of the roll-off selects their Deployment zone and places their first Agent, then Squads take turns deploying their Agents until all Agents have been deployed.  
The Mission briefing will determine which Squares are valid for each Squad's Deployment.

## Turns

During each Turn:
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Agents as Ready (not Activated)
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events (e.g. "Heal")
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Highest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events (if any) for this Turn
1. Agent activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Agent, then Squads alternate activating their Agents until all Agents have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](#alternate-activations)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission
    1. Remove all Downed Agents from the Battlemap.

### Scoring Mission Points

Mission Points determine the winner of the battle. Each Mission will define conditions under which a Squad can score Mission Points.  

## Mission End

At the end of Turn 4, tally the total Mission Points for each Squad. The Squad with the highest number of Mission Points is declared the winner of the battle.

## Alternate Activations

Each player takes alternating turns activating the Agents in their Squad. For example, in order:
1. Player 1 activates their first Agent
1. Player 2 activates their first Agent
1. Player 1 activates their second Agent
1. Player 2 activates their second Agent
1. Player 1 activates their third Agent
1. Player 2 activates their third Agent
1. (etc)

If a player has fewer Agents in play than their opponent, you may run into cases where your opponent still has Agents to activate but all your own Agents have already been activated. In those cases, when it is your turn to activate an Agent, you may choose to have one of your Agents perform a Sentry action.  

## Actions

During its activation, an Agent can perform a number of Actions up to its `ACT` stat *(see [StatCards](../2.Squads/1.StatCards.md))*.  
Each Action costs a number of Action Points or `ACT`.

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two (for example, if an Agent's skill costs `2 ACT`, you can spend 1 `ACT` + 1 `TO` to perform that action).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

## Sentry Actions

Sentry Actions:
- Do not cost `ACT` or `TO` to perform
- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn (meaning each Agent can only perform one Sentry action per Turn)
- Do not count against the maximum limit of Actions performed per Turn (meaning an Agent may use a Sentry Action for Ranged Combat even if they already performed a Ranged Combat Action during their activation in this Turn)
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

## Dice Rolls

Skirm uses 6-sided dice for all rolls. These will be indicated throughout the rules as `D6`.  
Some rolls will require more than one die. For those, the number of dice to roll will be indicated before `D6`.  
For example, to indicate a roll of 3 dice: `3D6`. To indicate a roll of 1 die: `1D6`.

### Modifying A Die Result

Some rolls will require adding a number to a die's value. For example, to indicate a roll whose result should be increased by `2`: `1D6+2`. This means roll a die, then add `2` to its value to get the final value.

### Rolling A D3

Some rolls will require roll a `D3`. Since three-sided dice are not readily available, roll a `D6` and divide its result by `2`, rounding up.

### Successes and Failures

When rolling against a character or weapon stat, a die roll is a success if its value is equal to or lower than that stat.  
Irrespective of any modifiers or Stats, a die roll of `6` is always a failure.  
A die roll of `1` is always a success, and counts as two successes.

### Re-Rolls

Certain rules and events allow you to re-roll a die. In those cases, announce the die to be re-rolled, pick it up, and roll it again. Once a die is re-rolled, its result is final and it cannot be re-rolled again.

## Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, each player rolls `3D6` and adds 1 die for each standing Agent's `LDx` Special Rule. For example, if your Leader is Standing and has the `LD2` Special Rule, you would roll `5D6` for Tactical Orders (3 base dice for Tactical Orders plus 2 dice provided by your Leader).  
If you do not have a Standing Agent with the `LDx` Special Rule on the Battlemap, you do not get their Tactical Order bonus and just roll `3D6`.

For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order. Tactical Orders allow Agents to perform more Actions than their `ACT` Action limit.

At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost; they do not carry over to the following Turn.

Note that rolling for Tactical Orders cannot be modified by using Tactical Orders.

### Using Tactical Orders

During an Agent's activation, you may spend any number of Tactical Orders you obtained for that Turn on more actions for that Agent. Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action (Move, Dash, Shoot, Melee, etc.) during an Agent's Activation
    * Note that a same Action cannot be performed more than once by a given Agent during their Activation (regardless of whether that Agent used ACT or TOs to perform it) unless that Agent has Special rules indicating otherwise (e.g. `2R` - Double Ranged Combat - See [Special Rules](../2.Squads/3.SpecialRules.md)).
* Re-roll any one die for any roll (including during one of your opponent's Agents' Activations, for example during Melee combat)
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1. Note that this is stackable; you can spend 2 TOs to reduce the result of a die by 2, or spend multiple TOs on multiple dice in a given roll.

## Scoring Points And Controlling Objectives

Each Battle Map will have Objectives placed on it. Depending on the mission, these Objectives may need to be controlled to score Mission Points.

An Agent that occupies the same Square as an Objective is said to control that Objective. At the end of each Turn, your Squad scores one Mission Point for each Objective that one of your Agents controls.

# The Rules

## Stat Cards

StatCards describe your Agents and their Weapons with numerical values. In general, the higher the number, the better the Agent or Weapon.  
StatCards also indicate important Tags that apply to the Agent and Special Actions or Abilities the Agent has.

Some Agents will have Skills listed on their StatCard. These are unique properties of that Agent that may allow them to perform a specific unique Action, or gain a bonus (or debuff) for certain game mechanics.

Note that Skills that have a **TO** cost (as above) **cannot** be performed using the Agent's **ACT** Stat; they **must** be performed by spending [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).  
Skills that have an AP cost can be performed using the Agent's AP Stat **or** a [Tactical Order](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).

Skills that do not have an **AP** or **TO** cost are passive skills that do not require spending an Action Point or Tactical Order.

## Actions

# Actions

During its activation, an Agent can perform a number of Actions up to its `ACT` stat *(see [StatCards](../2.Squads/1.StatCards.md))*.  
Each Action costs a number of Action Points or `ACT`.

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two (for example, if an Agent's skill costs `2 ACT`, you can spend 1 `ACT` + 1 `TO` to perform that action).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](../1.Introduction/2.Basics.md#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

## Basic Actions

All Agents can perform the following Actions during their Activation:

### Move (1 ACT)

The Agent moves a number of squares up to its `MOV` stat.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](./2.Movement.md))*

### Dash (1 ACT)

The Agent moves up to `2` Squares. This movement follows the same rules as a normal Move.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](./2.Movement.md))*

### Shoot (1 ACT)

The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target. Note that if an Agent does not have a Range weapon, it cannot perform this Action.  
*(See also [Actions - Combat](./3.Combat.md))*

### Melee (1 ACT)

Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.  
*(See also [Actions - Combat](./4.Combat.md))*

### Open/Close Door (1 ACT)

The Agent opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

### Pick Up (1 ACT)

The Agent picks up a marker or token that is in the Square it currently occupies. The mission you are playing will indicate which markers or tokens can be picked up or dropped.

### Drop (1 ACT)

The Agent drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies. The mission you are playing will indicate which markers or tokens can be picked up or dropped.

### Revive (2 TO)
The Agent revives a [Downed](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md) Agent in an Adjacent Square.  
When an Downed Agent is revived, it returns with `1D3` `HIT` remaining, and it cannot be activated during this Turn (it is considered to have already been activated).  
The Agent cannot perform this Action in the same activation in which it performed an Advanced Revive Action.  
The Agent cannot perform this action if it is Adjacent to a Standing Enemy Agent, or if the Downed Agent is Adjacent to a Standing Enemy Agent.

## Mission Actions

Certain Missions will define special Actions that can be performed by Agents. Read the Mission Briefing to determine if the Mission defines any such Actions.

## Movement

Movement in Skirm is measured in Squares.

If an Agent wants to move vertically (up or down), it must do so against a wall that is marked as Climbable, or whose height is 1 Square tall. Note that this does not apply to slopes or stairs. Stairs and slopes can be treated as horizontal movement that gives free vertical movement.

Agents cannot traverse walls; they must move around or climb over them.

When an Agent moves on the Battle Map, the maximum distance it can travel is given in Squares by its `MOV` stat. Movement can be done along any cardinal direction (North, South, East, West) or in diagonal (North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West).

### Diagonal Movement

Note that diagonal movement can only happen if the Squares perpendicular to the diagonal direction are not occupied or blocked.  
For example, for an Agent to move North-West, both Squares at its North and West must be unoccupied and traversable.

### Occupied Squares

Two Agents cannot share the same Square; each Square can only be occupied by a maximum of 1 Agent.  
Note that an Agent cannot pass through a Square that is adjacent to an enemy Agent, unless they end their movement in that Square (to prepare for Melee Combat).

### Difficult Terrain

Some Squares will be marked as "Difficult", indicating that they take more effort to traverse. Entering a Difficult Square only costs 1 `MOV` (as normal), but leaving that Square to another Square costs 2 `MOV`.  
If an Agent moves from one Difficult Square to another Difficult Square, cost remains 2 `MOV`.

### Vertical Movement

If there is a wall 1 Square high between two Squares (and they are on the same level), moving across that wall costs 2 `MOV`.  
Climbing vertical terrain costs 1 `MOV` per vertical Square, plus 1 `MOV` for the horizontal direction desired.  
Note that for an Agent to climb a wall, that wall must be mutually agreed by both players to be Climbable at the start of the battle. Generally these walls will be easily identifiable with a ladder or other visual marker indicating it is climbable.

## Combat

Ranged and Melee combat uses the same general process for determining hits and damage. The main difference is in target selection.

### Step by Step

1. **Selections**
    1. Ranged Combat:
        1. The Attacker selects one of its Ranged weapons to use in this Shoot action.
        1. If the Attacker has no Ranged weapons, it cannot perform this action.
        1. The Attacker selects a valid Target.
            1. If the selected weapon has a limited range (Weapon Special Rule `RGx`), make sure the Target is within the weapon's range.
            1. The selected target must be at least 2 Squares away; an Agent cannot target an Agent in an adjacent Square with a ranged weapon.
            1. The selected Target must be in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](../1.Introduction/5.LineOfSight.md)
    1. Melee Combat:
        1. The Attacker selects a valid target in an Adjacent square
            - Target may be in a horizontally adjacent square that is on the same vertical level as the Attacker, or 1 square above or below the Attacker's vertical level
        1. The Attacker selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
        1. The Target selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
1. **Roll Attacks** - Determine if the Attacker's weapon reached the Target
    1. Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA` (Rate of Attack) + applicable [Modifiers]().
    1. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` (Skill) is a successful Attack. Note that die results of 1 are always successes and count as two successes, and die results of 6 are always failures.
1. **Roll Saves** - Determine how much damage the Attacker inflicted on the Target
    1. For each of the Attacker's successful Attacks, the Target rolls one Save die
    1. If a die result is equal to or lower than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target's Armor absorbed the damage from this attack
    1. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target loses one `HIT`
    1. Note that die results of 1 are always successes and count as two successes, and die results of 6 are always failures
    1. For example, the Attacker scored 3 successful hits in their Hits roll. The Target now has to roll 3 dice (one per successful hit) to determine which ones penetrated their armor. The Target has an `ARM` of 7 and the Attacker's selected weapon has `DAM` of 3. Die results of 4 (`ARM` 7 - `DAM` 3 = 4) or less will be successful saves, and each result of 5 or 6 will reduce the Target's `HIT` by `1`

### Modifiers

#### Ranged Combat Modifiers

Modifiers can apply to the Attacker's selected Weapon's `ROA` or `SKL` Stats, or to the Target's `ARM` Stat.  
Note that after all Modifiers have been applied, a die roll of 6 is always a failure, and a die roll of 1 is always a success. In addition, a die roll of 1 is always counted as two successes.  
In addition to these standard modifiers, some Agents' Special Actions, Special Rules, or [Skills](../2.Squads/1.StatCards.md#skills) may apply additional modifiers to the Attack or Save rolls.

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is at least 2 Squares lower than Attacker|Attacker `SKL` +1|
|Friendly Fire|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` -1|
|Cover|Target is in [Cover](../1.Introduction/6.LineOfSight.md#cover)|Target `ARM` +1|

#### Melee Combat Modifiers

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is 1 Square lower than Attacker|Attacker `SKL` +1|
|Support|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` +1|

## Line Of Sight

A Target is said to be in an Attacker's **Line of Sight** if:

* An interrupted line can be drawn from one of the corners of the Square occupied by the Attacker to two corners of the Square occupied by the Target.

### Hitbox

An Agent's **Hitbox** defines the area that can be targeted for a Ranged attack. The Hitbox is a cylinder whose radius is the Agent model's base and whose height is the top of the Agent's head.  
This means that any part of the Agent's model that extends beyond the bounds of its base (e.g. extended arms) or extend above its head (e.g. raised weapon) are not considered targetable areas for a Ranged attack.

### Cover

If a Target model can be seen from the Attacker's head but its base cannot be seen in its entirety from the Attacker's head, that Target is in Cover (see [Modifiers](../3.Actions/3.Combat.md#modifiers) for the effects of Cover).
