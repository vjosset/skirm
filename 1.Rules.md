# SKIRM - The Rules

## About

***SKIRM - Strike Team: Behind Enemy Lines: Elite Battle Commandos: Attack Patrol Squads***

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.

When designing the game, there were a few principles that guided all decisions on play style and core mechanics:
- Must be **FUN**
- Must be fast to set up and to play
    - Games should not last longer than one hour
    - Each player should only need a handful of miniatures to play (5-10)ro
- Must be easy for newcomers to learn
    - Simple rules
    - Simple mechanics
- Must not use tokens on the board
    - The last thing you want is a miniature with 6 tokens on it that you have to carry with it when it moves and that would crowd the battle zone
- Must use simple rules and tools
    - No rulers or gauges - Use "Squares" (a simple grid) for measuring distances
    - 6-sided dice for all rolls

# Core Mechanics

## Dice Rolls

Skirm uses 6-sided dice for all rolls. These will be indicated throughout the rules as `D6`.  
Some rolls will require more than one die. For those, the number of dice to roll will be indicated before `D6`.  
For example, to indicate a roll of 3 dice: `3D6`. To indicate a roll of 1 die: `1D6`.

### Modifying A Die Result

Some rolls will require adding a number to a die's value. For example, to indicate a roll whose result should be increased by `2`: `1D6+2`. This means roll a die, then add `2` to its value to get the final value.

### Rolling A D3

Some rolls will require roll a `D3`. Since three-sided dice are not readily available, roll a `D6` and divide its result by `2`, rounding up.

### Successes and Failures

When rolling against a character or weapon stat, a die roll is a success if its value is equal to or lower than that stat.  
Irrespective of any modifiers or Stats, a die roll of `6` is always a failure and a die roll of `1` is always a success, treated as a **Critical** success (see also [Critical Chains](#critical-chains)).  

### Critical Chains

A die roll of `1` is a **Critical** success and is always a success. Some rules may change the die results that are treated as **Critical** (for example `CR2` indicates that die rolls of `1` and `2` are treated as Critical).  
When a player rolls a `1`, this starts a **Critical Chain**. For each `1` rolled by a player, that player may roll another die to attempt to get more successes. If any of those follow-up rolls also result in a `1`, then the chain continues, and the player has more chances at successes.

### Re-Rolls

Certain rules and events allow you to re-roll a die. In those cases, announce the die to be re-rolled, pick it up, and roll it again. Once a die is re-rolled, its result is final and it cannot be re-rolled again.

## Actions

During its [activation](#alternate-activations), an Agent can perform a number of Actions up to its `ACT` stat *(see [StatCards](#stat-cards))*.  
Each Action costs a number of Action Points or `ACT`.

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two (for example, if an Agent's skill costs `2 ACT`, you can spend 1 `ACT` + 1 `TO` to perform that action).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

## Game Cycle

A game of Skirm is played in the following order:

1. **Mission Start**
   1. **Select [Mission](2.Missions)**  
   Select a Mission to play. Both players must reach consensus on the Mission to play.
   1. **Select [Squad](#squads-and-agents)**  
   Select one of your Squads to take on the Mission
   1. **Prepare Battle Map**  
   Set up your Battlemap according to the Mission's briefing. This includes placing buildings and other terrain features, placing objectives, and any other actions defined by the selected Mission.
   1. **Deploy Agents**  
   Roll-off to determine the first Squad to deploy their first Agent, lowest score wins (re-roll ties). The winner of the roll-off selects their Deployment zone and places their first Agent, then Squads take turns deploying their Agents until all Agents have been deployed.  
The Mission briefing will determine which Squares are valid for each Squad's Deployment.
1. **Turns**
   1. Turn 1
   1. Turn 2
   1. Turn 3
   1. Turn 4
1. **Mission End**  
At the end of Turn 4, tally the total Mission Points for each Squad. The Squad with the highest number of Mission Points is declared the winner of the battle.

### Turns

During each Turn:
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Agents as Ready (not Activated)
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events (e.g. "Heal")
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Lowest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events (if any) for this Turn
1. Agent activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Agent, then Squads alternate activating their Agents until all Agents have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](#alternate-activations) and [Sentry Actions](#sentry-actions)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission

### Alternate Activations

Skirm uses Alternate Activations:  
During each turn, players take alternating turns to Activate their Squad's Agents. So player 1 activates their first Agent, then player 2 activates their first Agent, followed by player 1 activating their second Agent etc. This ensures dynamic play and avoids having to wait long periods of time before you can actually *do* something with your Squad.

Each player takes alternating turns activating the Agents in their Squad. For example, in order:
1. Player 1 activates their first Agent
1. Player 2 activates their first Agent
1. Player 1 activates their second Agent
1. Player 2 activates their second Agent
1. Player 1 activates their third Agent
1. Player 2 activates their third Agent
1. (etc)

If a player has fewer Agents in play than their opponent, you may run into cases where your opponent still has Agents to activate but all your own Agents have already been activated. In those cases, when it is your turn to activate an Agent, you may choose to have one of your Agents perform a [Sentry action](#sentry-actions).  

### Scoring Mission Points And Controlling Objectives

Mission Points determine the winner of the battle. Each Mission will define conditions under which a Squad can score Mission Points.  
Each Battle Map will have Objectives placed on it. Depending on the mission, these Objectives may need to be controlled to score Mission Points.  
An Agent that occupies the same Square as an Objective is said to control that Objective if there are no enemy Agents in Adjacent Squads.  
At the end of each Turn, your Squad scores one Mission Point for each Objective that one of your Agents controls.

# The Rules

## Stat Cards

StatCards describe your Agents and their Weapons with numerical values, and any special Skills they may have. In general, the higher the stat number, the better the Agent or Weapon.  
StatCards also include important Tags that apply to the Agent and Special Actions or Abilities the Agent has.

### Sample Card

> **Knight Sergeant**
> 
> |Agent|ACT|MOV|ARM|HIT|Special|

|HIT|**Hit Points**|The maximum amount of Damage this Agent can receive before it is removed from battle.|
|Special|**Special**|Special rules for this Agent (see [Agent Special Rules](#agent-special-rules)).|

### Tags

> **Tags:** *Terran, Knight, Leader, Sergeant*

Each Agent will have a list of **Tags**. These Tags are used for certain Special Rules, for example for Target selection for special Actions that can only affect Agents that match one or more Tags.

### Weapon Stats

> |Weapon|TYP|ROA|SKL|DAM|Special|
> |:---------------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----|
> |Combat Rifle|R|4|5|3|RR6|

### Skills

> **Skills**
> 
> * **War Cry (1 TO):** All squadmates within 5 Squares of this Agent gain +1 `ROA` to their Ranged and Melee weapons

Some Agents will have Skills listed on their StatCard. These are unique properties of that Agent that may allow them to perform a specific unique Action, or gain a bonus (or debuff) for certain game mechanics.

Note that Skills that have a **TO** cost (as above) **cannot** be performed using the Agent's **ACT** Stat; they **must** be performed by spending [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).  
Skills that have an AP cost can be performed using the Agent's AP Stat **or** a [Tactical Order](#tactical-orders).

Skills that do not have an **AP** or **TO** cost are passive skills that do not require spending an Action Point or Tactical Order.

## Actions

During its activation, an Agent can perform a number of Actions up to its `ACT` stat *(see [StatCards](#stat-cards))*.  
Each Action costs a number of Action Points or `ACT`.

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Agent's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two (for example, if an Agent's skill costs `2 ACT`, you can spend 1 `ACT` + 1 `TO` to perform that action).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Agent may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

### Basic Actions

All Agents can perform the following Actions during their Activation:

**Move (1 ACT)**  
The Agent moves a number of Squares up to its `MOV` stat.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](#movement))*

**Dash (1 ACT)**  
The Agent moves up to `1` Square. This movement follows the same rules as a normal Move.  
*(See also [Actions - Movement](#movement))*

**Shoot (1 ACT)**  
The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target. Note that if an Agent does not have a Range weapon, it cannot perform this Action.  
*(See also [Actions - Combat](#combat))*

**Melee (1 ACT)**  
Melee Combat occurs when two Agents are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.  
*(See also [Actions - Combat](#combat))*

**Open/Close Door (1 ACT)**  
The Agent opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

**Pick Up/Drop (1 ACT)**  
The Agent picks up or drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies.

### Sentry Actions

If a player has fewer Agents in play than their opponent, you may run into cases where your opponent still has Agents to activate but all your own Agents have already been activated. In those cases, when it is your turn to activate an Agent, you may choose to have one of your Agents perform a [Sentry action](#sentry-actions).  

Sentry Actions:
- Do not cost `ACT` or `TO` to perform
- Cannot be performed by the same Agent more than once during a Turn (meaning each Agent can only perform at most one Sentry Action per Turn)
- Do not count against the maximum limit of Actions performed per Turn (meaning an Agent may use a Sentry Action for Ranged Combat even if they already performed a Ranged Combat Action during their activation in this Turn)
- May only be one of the following Actions (no mission Actions or special Actions):
  - Melee Combat
  - Ranged Combat
  - Dash

### Mission Actions

Certain Missions will define special Actions that can be performed by Agents. Read the Mission Briefing to determine if the Mission defines any such Actions.

## Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, each player rolls `3D6` and adds 1 die for each of the Squad's Agents' `LDx` Special Rule. For example, if your Leader is still in play and has the `LD2` Special Rule, you would roll `5D6` for Tactical Orders (3 base dice for Tactical Orders plus 2 dice provided by your Leader).  
If you do not have an Agent with the `LDx` Special Rule on the Battlemap, you do not get their Tactical Order bonus and just roll `3D6`.

For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order. Tactical Orders allow Agents to perform more Actions than their `ACT` Action limit.

At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost; they do not carry over to the following Turn.

Note that rolling for Tactical Orders cannot be modified by using Tactical Orders.

### Using Tactical Orders

During an Agent's activation, you may spend any number of Tactical Orders you obtained for that Turn on more actions for that Agent. Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action (Move, Dash, Shoot, Melee, etc.) during an Agent's Activation
    * Note that a same Action cannot be performed more than once by a given Agent during their Activation (regardless of whether that Agent used `ACT` or `TO` to perform it) unless that Agent has Special rules indicating otherwise (e.g. `2R` - Double Ranged Combat - See [Special Rules](#special-rules)).
* Re-roll any one die for any roll (including during one of your opponent's Agents' Activations, for example during Melee combat)
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1. Note that this is stackable; you can spend 2 `TO` to reduce the result of a die by 2, or spend multiple `TO` on multiple dice in a given roll.

## Movement

Movement in Skirm is measured in Squares. Each Square on the battle map is 1.5 inches (or 38 mm).  A Battlemap is typically 16 x 16 Squares (or 24 by 24 inches).

Agents cannot traverse walls; they must move around or climb over them.  
If an Agent wants to move vertically (up or down), it must do so against a wall that is marked as Climbable, or whose height is 1 Square tall. Note that this does not apply to slopes or stairs. Stairs and slopes can be treated as horizontal movement and vertical movement is free.  

When an Agent moves on the Battle Map, the maximum distance it can travel is given in Squares by its `MOV` stat. Movement can be done along any cardinal direction (North, South, East, West) or in diagonal (North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West).

### Diagonal Movement

Note that diagonal movement can only happen if the Squares perpendicular to the diagonal direction are not occupied or blocked.  
For example, for an Agent to move North-West, both Squares at its North and West must be unoccupied and traversable.

### Occupied Squares

Two Agents cannot share the same Square; each Square can only be occupied by a maximum of 1 Agent.  
An Agent cannot pass through a Square that is adjacent to an enemy Agent, unless they end their movement in that Square (to prepare for Melee Combat).

### Difficult Terrain

Some Squares will be marked as "Difficult", indicating that they take more effort to traverse. Entering a Difficult Square only costs 1 `MOV` (as normal), but leaving that Square to another Square costs 2 `MOV`.  
If an Agent moves from one Difficult Square to another Difficult Square, cost remains 2 `MOV`.

### Vertical Movement

If there is a wall 1 Square high between two Squares (and they are on the same level), moving across that wall costs 2 `MOV`.  
Climbing up vertical terrain costs 1 `MOV` per vertical Square, plus 1 `MOV` for the horizontal direction desired.  
Note that for an Agent to climb a wall, that wall must be mutually agreed by both players to be Climbable at the start of the battle. Generally these walls will be easily identifiable with a ladder or other visual marker indicating it is climbable.  
Climbing down a wall follows the same rules as climbing up, but vertical movement costs 1 less `MOV`.

## Combat

Ranged and Melee combat uses the same general process for determining hits and damage. The main difference is in target selection.

### Ranged Combat

1. **Selections**
    1. If the Attacker in Adjacent to any enemy Agents, it cannot perform a Ranged Combat Action.
    1. The Attacker selects one of its Ranged weapons to use in this Shoot action.
    1. If the Attacker has no Ranged weapons, it cannot perform this action.
    1. The Attacker selects a valid Target.
        1. If the selected weapon has a limited range (Weapon Special Rule `RGx`), make sure the Target is within the weapon's range.
        1. The selected target must be at least 2 Squares away; an Agent cannot target an Agent in an adjacent Square with a ranged weapon.
        1. The selected Target must be in the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](#line-of-sight)
1. **Roll Hits** - Determine if the Attacker's weapon reached the Target
    1. Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA` (Rate of Attack) + applicable [Modifiers](#ranged-combat-modifiers).
    1. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the selected weapon's `SKL` (Skill) is a successful Hit. Note that die results of 1 are treated as Critical successes and trigger a [Critical Chain](#critical-chains), and die results of 6 are always failures.
1. **Roll Saves** - Determine how much damage the Attacker inflicted on the Target
    1. The Target rolls one Save die for each of the Attacker's `ROA`
    1. If a die result is equal to or lower than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target's Armor absorbed the damage from this Hit
    1. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the Target loses one `HIT`
    1. Note that die results of 1 are treated as Critical successes and trigger a [Critical Chain](#critical-chains), and die results of 6 are always failures.

### Melee Combat

1. **Selections**
    1. The Attacker selects a valid target in an Adjacent Square
        - Target may be in a horizontally adjacent Square that is on the same vertical level as the Attacker, or 1 Square above or below the Attacker's vertical level
    1. The Attacker selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
    1. The Target selects one of its Melee weapons to use in this Melee action
1. **Roll Hits** - Determine successful hits
    1. Attacker and Target roll one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA` (Rate of Attack) + applicable [Modifiers](#melee-combat-modifiers).
1. **Compare Hits** - Determine which hits made it through
    1. For each successful hit that either Agent got above the other Agent, the Agent with fewer successful hits rolls one save
    1. The Agent with more hits is the "winner"; the Agent with fewer hits is the "loser"
    1. Reduce the number of the winner's successful Hits by the loser's number of successful hits - These are hits that the loser could not counter or parry
1. **Roll Saves** - Determine how much damage the loser received
    1. For each of the winner's remaining successful Hits, the loser rolls one Save die
    1. If a die result is equal to or lower than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the loser's Armor absorbed the damage from this attack
    1. If a die result is higher than `ARM` - `DAM`, then the loser loses one `HIT`
    1. Note that die results of 1 are always successes and count as two successes, and die results of 6 are always failures

### Modifiers

#### Ranged Combat Modifiers

Modifiers can apply to the Attacker's selected Weapon's `ROA` or `SKL` Stats, or to the Target's `ARM` Stat.  
Note that after all Modifiers have been applied, a die roll of 6 is always a failure, and a die roll of 1 is always a success. In addition, a die roll of 1 is always counted as two successes.  
In addition to these standard modifiers, some Agents' Special Actions, Special Rules, or [Skills](#skills-1) may apply additional modifiers to the Attack or Save rolls.

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is at least 2 Squares lower than Attacker|Attacker `SKL` +1|
|Friendly Fire|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` -1|

#### Melee Combat Modifiers

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is 1 Square lower than Attacker|Attacker `SKL` +1|
|Support (Attacker)|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` +1|
|Support (Target)|One or more of the Target's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Attacker|Target `ROA` +1|
|Target|The Target always gets this modifier|Attacker `ROA` - 1|

### Damage

During the battle, Agents will inflict **Damage** on each other, or receive Damage from the Environment. Damage is a measurement of how badly an attack hurt an Agent.

When inflicting Damage on an Agent (as a result of a [Combat](#combat) Action for example):

* The Target will lose a number of `HIT` equal to the number of failed saves.
* If an Agent reaches zero or fewer `HIT`, it is removed from the battle.

### Line Of Sight

A Target is said to be in an Attacker's **Line of Sight** if two uninterrupted lines can be drawn from one of the corners of the Square occupied by the Attacker to two corners of the Square occupied by the Target.  
Note that an Agent cannot target an enemy Agent for Ranged Combat if there are other Agents on that Line of Sight (i.e. an Agent cannot shot "through" other Agents).

## Battle Map

The Skirm Battle Map is a grid of 1.5" (or 40mm). All movement and distance/range measurements are done by counting Squares. The total size of the Battle Map is typically 16 by 16 Squares.

### Squares

All movement and distance measurements in Skirm are measured in Squares. No need for tape measures, gauges, or rulers!  
The game designers selected to use a grid for simplicity of movement and measurement and to avoid imprecision in moving miniatures and checking weapon ranges. But if you don't have a gridded play area, you can use a ruler and convert each Square to 1.5 inches.

### Movement

*See [Basic Actions](#basic-actions) and [Movement](#movement)*

### Adjacent Squares

All 8 Squares surrounding a given Square are considered to be **Adjacent** to that Square. When selecting a valid target for Melee combat (*see [Actions](#actions)*), the initiator and its target must be in adjacent Squares. Note that two Squares that have a height difference of more than 1 Square are not considered to be adjacent.  
Note that if a wall that is higher than 1 Square is between two Squares, those two Squares are not considered to be **Adjacent**.

### Distances And Range

To measure the distance between two Squares (for example, to check if a target is within the Range of a given Ranged Weapon), take the *highest* number of the following two measurements:
* The **horizontal** distance between the shooter and its target (excluding height differences)
* The **vertical** distance between the shooter and its target (excluding horizontal distance)

The target is considered to be in range of that weapon if the lower number is equal to or lower than the weapon's range.

## Special Rules

These standard Special Rules can be found on various Agents and their Weapons. These charts indicate each Special Rule's meaning and interpretation in gameplay.

### Agent Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`2MC`|**Double Melee Combat**|This Agent can perform the [Melee Action](#combat) twice in its activation.|
|`2RC`|**Double Ranged Combat**|This Agent can perform the [Range Combat Action](#combat) twice in its activation.|
|`CAM`|**Camouflage**|When this Agent is the target of a Ranged Combat Attack and the Attacker is more than `3` Squares away, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful hits.|
|`DOD`|**Dodge**|When this Agent is the target of a Melee Combat Attack, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful hits.|
|`HLx`|**Heal x**|This Agent regains `x` lost `HIT` at the start of each Turn|
|`LDx`|**Leader x**|While this Agent is in the battle, you can roll for an additional `x` Tactical Orders every turn.|
|`TFx`|**Tough x**|Whenever this Agent would lose a `HIT`, roll `1D6`: on `x` or lower, that `HIT` is not lost.|

### Weapon Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`APx`|**Armor Piercing x**|When this weapon is used in [Combat](#combat), `x` successful Attacks cannot be saved by the Target. For example: Using an `AP1` Ranged weapon, the Target would roll 1 fewer Save dice than the Attacker's successful Attacks. If the Target has `CAM` (Camouflage) or `DOD` (Dodge), those automatic successful saves cannot be used against this Armor Piercing special rule.|
|`CRx`|**Critial x**|Die results of up to `x` (instead of only `1`) are treated as Critical, triggering a [Critical Chain](#critical-chains)|
|`HVY`|**Heavy**|This weapon is too heavy to shoot in the same activation as moving. Shooting this weapon after the Agent performed a Move Action costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). A Move Action performed after this Agent shot this weapon costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). Agents can perform a Dash Action with this weapon equipped without any penalties.|
|`LIM`|**Limited Ammo**|This weapon can only be used once during the battle.|
|`LNR`|**Linear**|All Agents (including squadmates) between the Attacker and original Target who occupy a Square that crosses the Line Of Sight are Targets. Resolve Attacks and Saves on each such Target separately.|
|`RGx`|**Range x**|The weapon's maximum range for target selection is `x` Squares|
|`RRx`|**Re-Roll x**|Attacker can re-roll up to `x` Attack dice|
|`VAx`|**Vampire x**|If at least one success inflicts [Damage](#damage) on the Target, this Agent regains `x` lost `HIT`|
|`XPL`|**Explode**|Every time the Agent fires this weapon, it fires against the target and any other Agent (including squadmates) in adjacent Squares to the original Target. Roll Attack dice for each affected Agent. Note that this weapon can target an unoccupied Square (rather than having to target an Agent).|
