# SKIRM

# Introduction

***SKIRM - Strike Team: Behind Enemy Lines: Elite Battle Commandos: Attack Patrol Squads***

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.

When designing the game, there were a few principles that guided all decisions on play style and core mechanics:
- Must be **FUN**
- Must be fast to set up and to play
    - Games should not last longer than one hour
    - Each player should only need a handful of miniatures to play (5-10)
- Must be easy for newcomers to learn
    - Simple rules
    - Simple mechanics
- Must not use tokens on the board
    - The last thing you want is a miniature with 6 tokens on it that you have to carry with it when it moves and that would crowd the battle zone
- Must use simple rules and tools
    - No rulers or gauges - Use "Squares" (a simple grid) for measuring distances
    - 6-sided dice for all rolls

# Core Mechanics

## Dice Rolls

Skirm uses 6-sided dice for all rolls. These will be indicated throughout the rules as `D6`.  
Some rolls will require more than one die. For those, the number of dice to roll will be indicated before `D6`.  
For example, to indicate a roll of 3 dice: `3D6`. To indicate a roll of 1 die: `1D6`.

### Modifying A Die Result

Some rolls will require adding a number to a die's value. For example, to indicate a roll whose result should be increased by `2`: `1D6+2`. This means roll a die, then add `2` to its value to get the final value.

### Successes and Failures

When rolling against a character or weapon stat, a die roll is a success if its value is equal to or lower than that stat.  
Irrespective of any modifiers or Stats, a die roll of `6` is always a failure and a die roll of `1` is always a success.

### Re-Rolls

Certain rules and events allow you to re-roll a die. In those cases, announce the die to be re-rolled, pick it up, and roll it again. Once a die is re-rolled, its result is final and it cannot be re-rolled again.

# Playing the game

## Game Cycle

A game of Skirm is played in the following order:

1. **Mission Start**
   1. **Select [Mission](2.Missions)**  
   Select a Mission to play. Both players must reach consensus on the Mission to play.
   1. **Select [Squad](#squads-and-Units)**  
   Select one of your Squads to take on the Mission
   1. **Prepare Battle Map**  
   Set up your Battlemap according to the Mission's briefing. This includes placing buildings and other terrain features, placing objectives, and any other actions defined by the selected Mission.
   1. **Deploy Units**  
   Roll-off to determine the first Squad to deploy their first Unit, lowest score wins (re-roll ties). The winner of the roll-off selects their Deployment zone and places their first Unit, then Squads take turns deploying their Units until all Units have been deployed.  
The Mission briefing will determine which Squares are valid for each Squad's Deployment.
1. **Turns**
   1. Turn 1
   1. Turn 2
   1. Turn 3
   1. [...]]
1. **Mission End**  
At the end of the Mission, the Squad with the highest number of Mission Points is declared the winner of the battle.

### Turns

During each Turn:
1. Start of Turn
    1. Mark all Units as Ready (not Activated)
    1. Resolve all "Start of Turn" actions or events (e.g. "Heal")
    1. Roll-off for Initiative
        1. Lowest score wins Initiative; both sides re-roll any ties until a winner is determined
    1. Roll for [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders) for the Turn
    1. The Squad with the Initiative rolls for the Mission's Events (if any) for this Turn
1. Unit activations
    1. The Squad with the Initiative activates their first Unit, then Squads alternate activating their Units until all Units have been activated.  
    See also [Alternate Activations](#alternate-activations)
1. End Of Turn
    1. Resolve all "End of Turn" actions or events
    1. Score Mission Points according to the selected Mission

### Alternate Activations

Skirm uses Alternate Activations:  
During each turn, players take alternating turns to Activate their Squad's Units. So player 1 activates their first Unit, then player 2 activates their first Unit, followed by player 1 activating their second Unit etc. This ensures dynamic play and avoids having to wait long periods of time before you can actually *do* something with your Squad.

Each player takes alternating turns activating the Units in their Squad. For example, in order:
1. Player 1 activates their first Unit
1. Player 2 activates their first Unit
1. Player 1 activates their second Unit
1. Player 2 activates their second Unit
1. Player 1 activates their third Unit
1. Player 2 activates their third Unit
1. (etc)

# Stat Cards

StatCards describe your Units and their Weapons with numerical values, and any special Skills they may have. In general, the higher the stat number, the better the Unit or Weapon.  
StatCards also include important Tags that apply to the Unit and Special Actions or Abilities the Unit has.

## Unit Stats

|Stat|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`ACT`|**Action Points**|The maximum number of Action Points this Unit can spend on [Actions](#actions-1) during its activation.|
|`MOV`|**Movement**|The maximum number of Squares this Unit can travel during a [Move Action](#movement).|
|`MSK`|**Melee Skill**|The Unit's skill in [Melee Combat](#melee-combat). In general, Melee Attack rolls equal to or lower than this stat are successes.|
|`RSK`|**Ranged Skill**|The Unit's skill in [Ranged Combat](#ranged-combat). In general, Ranged Attack rolls equal to or lower than this stat are successes.|
|`ARM`|**Armor**|Indicates how well this Unit resists damage during combat (see [Combat](#combat))|
|`HIT`|**Hit Points**|The maximum amount of [Damage](#damage) this Unit can receive before it is [Downed](#damage).|
|Special|**Special**|Special rules for this Unit (see [Unit Special Rules](#Unit-special-rules)).|

## Weapon Stats

|Stat|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`TYP`|**Weapon Type**|**R** indicates a Ranged weapon, **M** indicates a Melee weapon.|
|`ROA`|**Rate Of Attack**|Indicates the number of dice to roll when using this weapon.|
|`DAM`|**Damage**|Indicates how much [Damage](#damage) each successful strike with this weapons inflicts on a Target.|
|Special|**Special**|Special rules for this weapon (see [Weapon Special Rules](#weapon-special-rules)).|

## Skills

Some Units will have Skills listed on their StatCard. These are unique properties of that Unit that may allow them to perform a specific unique Action, or gain a bonus (or debuff) for certain game mechanics.

Note that Skills that have a `TO` cost (as above) **cannot** be performed using the Unit's `ACT` Stat; they **must** be performed by spending [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).  
Skills that have an `ACT` cost can be performed using the Unit's `ACT` Stat **or** a [Tactical Order](#tactical-orders).

Skills that do not have an `ACT` or `TO` cost are passive skills that do not require spending an Action Point or Tactical Order.

# Actions

During its activation, an Unit can perform a number of Actions up to its `ACT` stat *(see [StatCards](#stat-cards))*.  
Each Action costs a number of Action Points or `ACT`.

Actions with an `ACT` cost can be performed by spending the Unit's `ACT` Action Points or the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders), or any combination of the two (for example, if an Unit's skill costs `2 ACT`, you can spend 1 `ACT` + 1 `TO` to perform that action).  
Actions with a `TO` cost can only be performed by spending the Squad's [Tactical Orders](#tactical-orders).

Unless otherwise specified, an Unit may not perform the same Action more than once during its activation.

### Basic Actions

All Units can perform the following Actions during their Activation.  
Note that unless otherwise indicated, each Unit can only perform each Action once during its Activation. "Free" Actions provided by special skills do not count against this limit.  
Unless otherwise specified, Downed Units can only perform the **Recover** or **Dash** Actions.

**Move (1 ACT)**  
The Unit moves a number of Squares up to its `MOV` stat.  
*(See also [Movement](#movement))*

**Dash (1 ACT)**  
The Unit moves up to `1` Square. This movement follows the same rules as a normal Move.  
Downed Units may perform this Action during their Activation.
*(See also [ Movement](#movement))*

**Shoot (1 ACT)**  
The Unit fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target. Note that if an Unit does not have a Range weapon, it cannot perform this Action.  
*(See also [Combat](#combat))*

**Melee (1 ACT)**  
Melee Combat occurs when two Units are in adjacent Squares and one of them initiates a Melee action.  
*(See also [Combat](#combat))*

**Open/Close Door (1 ACT)**  
The Unit opens or closes a door that is on one of the edges of its current Square.

**Pick Up/Drop (1 ACT)**  
The Unit picks up or drops a marker or token in the Square it currently occupies.

**Recover (1 ACT)**  
The Downed Unit attempts to recover. The Unit performs a Recovery Roll by rolling one die against its `ARM` stat. Die results equal to or lower than the Unit's `ARM` stat are successful recoveries, and the Unit goes from Downed to Standing, and can now perform other Actions. Failed rolls have no effect and the Unit remains Downed.   
Downed Units may perform this Action during their Activation.

## Movement

Movement in Skirm is measured in Squares. Each Square on the battle map is 1.5 inches (or 38 mm).  A Battlemap is typically 16 x 16 Squares (or 24 by 24 inches).

Units cannot traverse walls; they must move around or climb over them.  
If an Unit wants to move vertically (up or down), it must do so against a wall that is marked as Climbable, or whose height is 1 Square tall. Note that this does not apply to slopes or stairs. Stairs and slopes can be treated as horizontal movement and vertical movement is free.  

When an Unit moves on the Battle Map, the maximum distance it can travel is given in Squares by its `MOV` stat. Movement can be done along any cardinal direction (North, South, East, West) or in diagonal (North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West).

### Diagonal Movement

Note that diagonal movement can only happen if the Squares perpendicular to the diagonal direction are not occupied or blocked.  
For example, for an Unit to move North-West, both Squares at its North and West must be unoccupied and traversable.

### Occupied Squares

Two Units cannot share the same Square; each Square can only be occupied by a maximum of 1 Unit.  
An Unit cannot pass through a Square that is adjacent to an enemy Unit, unless they end their movement in that Square (to prepare for Melee Combat).

### Difficult Terrain

Some Squares will be marked as "Difficult", indicating that they take more effort to traverse. Entering a Difficult Square only costs 1 `MOV` (as normal), but leaving that Square to another Square costs 2 `MOV`.  
If an Unit moves from one Difficult Square to another Difficult Square, cost remains 2 `MOV`.

### Vertical Movement

If there is a wall 1 Square high between two Squares (and they are on the same level), moving across that wall costs 2 `MOV`.  
Climbing up vertical terrain costs 1 `MOV` per vertical Square, plus 1 `MOV` for the horizontal direction desired.  
Note that for an Unit to climb a wall, that wall must be mutually agreed by both players to be Climbable at the start of the battle. Generally these walls will be easily identifiable with a ladder or other visual marker indicating it is climbable.  
Climbing down a wall follows the same rules as climbing up, but vertical movement costs 1 less `MOV`.

## Tactical Orders

At the start of each turn, each player rolls `3D6` and adds 1 die for each of the Squad's Leader's `LDx` Special Rule if the Leader is [Standing](#damage). For example, if your Leader is still Standing and has the `LD2` Special Rule, you would roll `5D6` for Tactical Orders (3 base dice for Tactical Orders plus 2 dice provided by your Leader).  
If you do not have an Unit with the `LDx` Special Rule on the Battlemap, you do not get their Tactical Order bonus and just roll `3D6`.

For each die result of `1-3`, you will have one Tactical Order. Tactical Orders allow Units to perform more Actions than their `ACT` Action limit.

At the end of each Turn, any unused Tactical Orders are lost; they do not carry over to the following Turn.

Note that rolling for Tactical Orders cannot be modified by using Tactical Orders.

### Using Tactical Orders

During an Unit's activation, you may spend any number of Tactical Orders you obtained for that Turn on more actions for that Unit. Tactical Orders may be spent to:
* Perform an Additional Basic Action (Move, Dash, Shoot, Melee, etc.) during an Unit's Activation
    * Note that a same Action cannot be performed more than once by a given Unit during their Activation (regardless of whether that Unit used `ACT` or `TO` to perform it) unless that Unit has Special rules indicating otherwise (e.g. `2R` - Double Ranged Combat - See [Special Rules](#special-rules)).
* Re-roll any one die for any roll (including during one of your opponent's Units' Activations, for example during Melee combat)
* Change the result of one of your rolled dice by +/- 1.
Note that this is stackable; you can spend 2 `TO` to reduce the result of a die by 2, or spend multiple `TO` on multiple dice in a given roll.
Also note that modifying a die roll in this way cannot turn a die roll into a Critical roll (e.g. reducing a die roll of `3` to `1` does not mean that die roll is a Critical succes and does not trigger a Critical Chain).

## Combat

Ranged and Melee combat uses the same general process for determining strikes and damage. The main difference is in target selection.

1. **Selections**
    1. The Attacker selects one of its weapons of the appropriate type to use in this combat
    1. The Attacker selects a valid target
        1. Ranged Combat: Target must be at least 2 Squares away from the Attacker, within the Weapon's range (`RGx`), and within the Attacker's [Line Of Sight](#line-of-sight)
        1. Melee Combat: Target may be in a horizontally adjacent Square that is on the same vertical level as the Attacker, or 1 Square above or below the Attacker's vertical level
1. **Roll Strikes** - Determine if the Attacker's weapon reached the Target
    1. Attacker rolls one die for each of the selected weapon's `ROA` (Rate of Attack) + applicable [Modifiers](#modifiers).
    1. Each die result that is equal to or lower than the Unit's appropriate Skill (`MSK` for Melee combat, `RSK` for Ranged combat) is a successful strike and inflicts `DAM` [Damage](#damage) on the Target. Note that die results of 1 are always successes, and die results of 6 are always failures.
1. **Roll Saves** - Determine how much [Damage](#damage) the Attacker inflicted on the Target
    1. The Target rolls one Save die for each point of `DAM` inflicted by the Attacker's weapon.
    1. If a Save die result is equal to or lower than the Target's `ARM`, then the Target's Armor absorbed the damage from this strike (successful Save).
    1. If the total unsaved rolls (failed Save rolls) for this Attack is equal to or greater than the Target's `HIT` Stat, the Target goes from Standing to Downed, or Downed to Out (see [Damage](#damage)).

#### Melee Combat Modifiers

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|**High Ground**|Target is 1 Square lower than Attacker|Attacker `MSK` +1|
|**Support (Attacker)**|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` +1|
|**Support (Target)**|One or more of the Target's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Attacker|Target `ARM` +1|

#### Ranged Combat Modifiers

|Condition|Description|Modifier|
|:---|:---|:---:|
|High Ground|Target is at least 2 Squares lower than Attacker|Attacker `RSK` +1|
|Friendly Fire|One or more of the Attacker's Squadmates is in an Adjacent Square to the Target|Attacker `ROA` -1|

## Damage

Each Unit starts in a Standing state.  
When a Standing Unit fails Save rolls equal to or higher than its `HIT` Stat, it goes to a Downed State. Downed Units should be placed on their side to indicate their State.  
When a Downed Unit fails Save rolls equal to or higher than its `HIT` Stat, it is Out and removed from the battlemap.  
Downed Units cannot perform any Actions other than Recover or Crawl during their Activation.

# Building A Squad

Squads are built by purchasing Units, Weapons, and Mods from their Faction List.  
Squads can only have one Leader Unit.  
When they are first created, Squads are limited to a total of 200 Points. Each Unit, Weapon, and Mod costs a number of Points that counts toward this limit.
