# Skirm

## Skirm: Strike Team: Behind Enemy Lines: Elite Commando Attack Squads 

Skirm is a miniature- and universe-agnostic table top miniatures skirmish wargame. It is intended to be easy to learn and quick to set up and play.

Skirm uses Alternate Activations: During each turn, players take alternating turns to Activate their Squad's Agents. So player 1 activates their first Agent, then player 2 activates their first Agent, followed by player 1 activating their second Agent etc. This ensures dynamic play and avoids having to wait long periods of time before you can actually *do* something with your Squad. *(See Game Cycle)*
