# Agent Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`LDx`|**Leader x**|While this Agent is [Standing](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md), you can roll for an additional `x` Tactical Orders every turn.|
|`2R`|**Double Ranged**|This Agent can perform the [Range Combat Action](../3.Actions/3.Combat.md) twice in its activation.|
|`2M`|**Double Melee**|This Agent can perform the [Melee Action](../3.Actions/3.Combat.md) twice in its activation.|
|`HLx`|**Heal x**|This Agent regains `x` lost `HIT` at the end of every Turn (unless it is **Downed**)|
|`CAM`|**Camouflage**|When this Agent is the target of a Ranged Combat Attack and the Attacker is more than `3` Squares away, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful hits.|
|`DOD`|**Dodge**|When this Agent is the target of a Melee Combat Attack, it gets one automatic successful save (without having to roll for it). Note that this automatic save does not save against `APx` (Armor Piercing) successful hits.|
|`TFx`|**Tough x**|Whenever this Agent would lose a `HIT`, roll `1D6`: on `x` or lower, that `HIT` is not lost.|

# Weapon Special Rules

|Rule|Title|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`RRx`|**Re-Roll x**|Attacker can re-roll up to `x` Attack dice|
|`CRx`|**Critial x**|Die results of up to `x` are treated as Critical, resulting in double successes. (instead of only `1`)|
|`RGx`|**Range x**|The weapon's maximum range for target selection is `x` Squares|
|`XPL`|**Explode**|Every time the Agent fires this weapon, it fires against the target and any other Agent (including squadmates) in adjacent Squares to the original Target. Roll Attack dice for each affected Agent. Note that this weapon can target an unoccupied Square (rather than having to target an Agent).|
|`LIM`|**Limited Ammo**|This weapon can only be used once during the battle.|
|`APx`|**Armor Piercing x**|When this weapon is used in [Combat](../3.Actions/3.Combat.md), `x` successful Attacks cannot be saved by the Target. For example: Using an `AP1` Ranged weapon, the Target would roll 1 fewer Save dice than the Attacker's successful Attacks. If the Target has `CAM` (Camouflage) or `DOD` (Dodge), those automatic successful saves cannot be used against this Armor Piercing special rule.|
|`VAx`|**Vampire x**|If at least one success inflicts [Damage](../1.Introduction/4.Damage.md) on the Target, this Agent regains `x` lost `HIT`|
|`HVY`|**Heavy**|This weapon is too heavy to shoot in the same activation as moving. Shooting this weapon after the Agent performed a Move Action costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). A Move Action performed after this Agent shot this weapon costs 2 `ACT` (instead of 1). Agents can perform a Dash Action with this weapon equipped without any penalties.|
|`LIN`|**Linear**|All Agents (including squadmates) between the Attacker and original Target who occupy a Square that crosses the Line Of Sight are Targets. Resolve Attacks and Saves on each such Target separately.|
|`NCV`|**No Cover**|The Target is never considered to be in [Cover](../1.Introduction/5.LineOfSight.md#cover)|
