# Shoot

The Agent fires one of its Ranged weapons at a valid target.

## Step By Step

1. The Attacker selects one of its Ranged weapons to use in this Shoot action
    1. If the Attacker has no Ranged weapons, it cannot perform this action
1. The Attacker selects a valid target
    1. If the selected weapon has a limited range (Weapon Special Rule `RGx`), make sure the Target is within the weapon's range
    1. The selected target must be at least 2 Squares away; an Agent cannot target an Agent in and adjacent Square with a ranged weapon.
1. The Attacker rolls the `ROA` dice for its selected Ranged weapon
1. All die results that are equal to or lower than the selected Ranged weapon's `HIT` stat are successes, any others are failures
1. For each success, inflict the selected Ranged weapon's `DAM` damage minus the Attacker's `AR` (Armor) value on the Target
