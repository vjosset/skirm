# Wandering Ancient Ship

A wandering ship, abandoned for hundreds of years. This ship has been roaming the cosmos aimlessly, gathering strays. These ships are said to hold invaluable ancient technology, and despite their extreme danger are an attractive target for Squads hoping to find powerful artefacts to supplement their arsenal.
