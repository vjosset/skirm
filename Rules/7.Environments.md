# Environments

When playing Skirm, the Environment on which your Squad finds itself can drastically change the strategy, tactics, and Agent options. Environments have unique associated buffs and debuffs, and random Events that occur on each turn.

At the start of each turn, the player with the initiative rolls `1D6` to select the Event random from the tables below.

# Ancient Wandering Ship

A wandering ship, abandoned for hundreds of years. This ship has been roaming the cosmos aimlessly, colliding with and agglomerating with other ships.
