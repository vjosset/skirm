# Skirm 2

Simpler than Skirm, with some changes.

## Notes
 
- No trackers that can't easily be handled on paper or in app
    - No tokens if possible, although seeing who is yet to be activated on board is useful
- No HP, but Units (not "Agents") have `ARM` (resistance) and `HIT` (how much `DAM` taken before being Downed)
- Downed vs Out ("DBNO")
    - Standing -> Downed -> Out
- No dice gimmicks (critical chains, W&G dice, Critical Hits, etc)
- Tactical Orders - Get more (or more changes) if Leader is Standing
    - Same uses (get rid of die modifier?)
- Even with equipment/skills/rewards, each Unit card should be simple
    - Don't want to have to remember a bunch of mods etc.
- Need an app
    - Make sure everything is printable as simple list
        - Doable while still having cards in the app?
- Quick ref + Short rulebook
- Factions and unit types should have a degree of specialization
    - More like KT than Doomed
    - KT has unchangeable stats on the units, just some extra equipment to add
    - Doomed lets you do pretty much anything with any unit
- Armory/Equipment List per faction
    - Shared by all units in the faction
    - Note some units come with own Weapons or Skills that cannot be obtained elsewhere
    - This means that success/skill is a Unit stat, not a Weapon stat
- Find a way to reward Melee
    - Difficult to get in range, so it has to hit hard when it hits

## Units

- Unit Stats
    - `ACT` - How many actions
    - `MOV` - Ho wmany squares (inches?) it can move
    - `MSK` - Melee Skill
    - `RSK` - Ranged Skill
    - `ARM` - Resistance to Damage
    - `HIT` - How many failed `ARM` saves to go from Standing -> Downed -> Out
    - Present Unit Stats in pairs?
        - Speed `SPD` 3/3 (`ACT`/`MOV`)
        - Combat `COM` 3/4 (`MSK`/`RSK`)
        - Defense `DEF` 4/1 (`ARM`/`HIT`)
- Weapon Stats
    - `ROA` - Rate of Attack (how many dice)
    - `DAM` - Damage (how much damage per successful strike)
    - Present Weapon stats in pairs?
        3/1(`ROA`/`DAM`)
- Standard Unit mods
    - Re-use the ones from Skirm 1 (and adjust)
- Standard Weapon mods
    - Re-use the ones from Skirm 1 (and adjust)
- Skills
    - Passive (no `ACT` or `TO` cost)
    - Active (`ACT` or `TO` cost)
    - Auto-apply mods to Unit or Weapon Stats (in app)
- Points cost to Units, Weapons, and Skills/Gear
    - Some Units have unique skills that come for free (no additional Points cost)

## Combat

- No opposed melee
- Cover benefit
- Easy Line Of Sight

## Actions

- Alternating activations
- No Sentry actions (= Overwatch)
    - Too bad if fewer models on board

## Missions

- Write a bunch of them

## Lore & Factions

- Don't re-use or translate existing stuff from other games (KT, Doomed, OPR GDFF, etc.)
    - Invent own ("heavily inspired by" of course)
- Need to be able to justify Intra-Faction battles
    - e.g. Space Marines vs Imperial Guard doesn't make sense in 40k/KT
- Tone/vibe
    - Military commandos?
    - Wacky space nonsense?
    - Faction-dependent?
    - Brutal bleak?
- [TBD]

## Campaign

- [TBD]

## Global Campaign

- Seasons/wars with record of battles
- Record results of battles in app
- Results at end of season/war cause changes & rewards for each faction
