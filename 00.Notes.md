# Skirm 2

Simpler than Skirm, with some changes.

## Notes

- No trackers that can't easily be handled on paper or in app
- No HP, but Units (not "Agents") have `ARM` (resistance) and `HIT` (how much `DAM` taken before being Downed)
- Downed vs Out ("DBNO")
    - Standing -> Downed -> Out
- No dice gimmicks (critical chains, W&G dice, Critical Hits, etc)
- Tactical Orders - Get more (or more changes) if Leader is Standing
    - Same uses (get rid of die modifier?)
- Even with equipment/skills/rewards, each Unit card should be simple
    - Don't want to have to remember a bunch of mods etc.
- Need an app
    - Make sure everything is printable as simple list
        - Doable while still having cards?

## Units

- Unit Stats
    - `ACT` - How many actions
    - `MOV` - Ho wmany squares (inches?) it can move

    - `ARM` - Resistance to Damage
    - `HIT` - How many failed `ARM` saves to go from Standing to Downed or Downed to Out

- Points cost to Units, Weapons, and Skills/Gear
    - Some Units have unique skills that come for free (no additional Points cost)

## Combat

- No opposed melee
- Cover benefit
- Easy Line Of Sight

## Actions

- Alternating activations
- No Sentry actions (= Overwatch)
    - Too bad if fewer models on board

## Missions

- Write a bunch of them

## Lore & Factions

- Don't re-use or translate existing stuff from other games (KT, Doomed, OPR GDFF, etc.)
    - Invent own ("heavily inspired by" of course)
- Need to be able to justify Intra-Faction battles
    - e.g. Space Marines vs Imperial Guard doesn't make sense in 40k/KT
- [TBD]

## Campaign

- [TBD]

## Global Campaign

- Seasons/wars with record of battles
- Record results of battles in app
- Results at end of season/war cause changes & rewards for each faction
