# Basics

This section covers the Basic rules of Skirm, and establishes core principles that are extended in later sections of the rules.

# Dice Rolls

## Basics

Skirm uses 6-sided dice for all rolls. These will be indicated throughout the rules as `D6`.

Some rolls will require more than one die. For those, the number of dice to roll will be indicated before `D6`. 

For example, to indicate a roll of 3 dice: `3D6`. To indicate a roll of 1 die: `1D6`.

## Successes and Failures

When rolling against a character or weapon stat, a die roll is a success if its value is equal to or lower than that stat.

Irrespective of any modifiers, a die result of **1** is always a success, and a result of **6** is always a failure.

## Re-Rolls

Certain rules and events allow you to re-roll a die. In those cases, announce the die to be re-rolled, pick it up, and roll it again. Once a die is re-rolled, its result is final and it cannot be re-rolled again.

## Hero Die

The Hero Die mechanic allows for unexpected or heroic actions.

For every roll, one of your dice must be your "hero" die. This die should be a different color than your normal dice to mark it clearly for you and your opponent.

When rolling `1D6`, that single die will be your Hero Die. When rolling `4D6`, roll 3 normal dice and 1 Hero Die.

If a Hero Die is a success, it counts as two successes. If a Hero Die is a failure, it is treated as a normal failure.

> ### Options to consider:
> * Skip Hero Die, make all 6s double successes
> * Skip Hero Die, make all 6s explode
> * Keep Hero Die, skip double successes, make Hero Die explode on success (or only 6s?)
