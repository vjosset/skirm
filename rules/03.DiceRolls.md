# Dice Rolls

## Basics

Skirm uses 6-sided dice for all rolls. These will be indicated throughout the rules as `D6`.

Some rolls will require more than one die. For those, the number of dice to roll will be indicated before `D6`. 

For example, to indicate a roll of 3 dice: `3D6`. To indicate a roll of 1 die: `1D6`.

## Hero Die

For every roll, one of your dice should be your "hero" die. This die should be a different color than your normal dice to mark it clearly for you and your opponent.

When rolling `1D6`, that single die will be your Hero Die. When rolling `4D6`, roll 3 normal dice and 1 Hero Die.

If a Hero Die is a success, it counts as two successes. IF a Hero Die is a failure, it is treated as a normal failure.
