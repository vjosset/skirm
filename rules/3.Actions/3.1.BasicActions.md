# Basic Actions

All Agents can perform the following Actions during their turn

# Move (1 AP)

Movement in Skirm is measured in Squares.

An Agent can move up to its `MV` stat when performing a Move action. 

If an Agent wants to move vertically (up or down), it must do so against a wall that is marked as Climbable, or whose height is 1 Square tall. Note that this does not apply to slopes or stairs. Stairs and slopes can be treated as horizontal movement that gives free vertical movement.

Agents cannot traverse walls, they must move around or climb over them.
